Scallion Pancakes
Difficulty level: 3
Makes: 4 scallion pancakes

Ingredients
1 cup flour
½ cup of water, boiled
2 scallions
Oil
Salt

In a small pot, gradually add and mix the water with the flour. Once the mixture cools, rub fingertips with oil and pull the dough clumps together. If the mixture is too dry, add a little cold water; likewise, if the dough is too wet, add 1-2 tbsp of flour. Use fingertips to work dough together. A little sticky and firm. Cover and let it rest for half an hour. Wash and chop scallions. Once the dough is done, divide into 4 pieces. Take one piece and roll it out into a circle. Rub a layer of oil on the surface, then sprinkle scallion on top. Roll up into a tube and then into a spiral, then roll it out again into a circle, about ½ cm thick. Sprinkle salt on. Repeat with the remaining dough and scallions. In a small skillet, pan fry each pancake in oil.
